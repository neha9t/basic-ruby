# Create a method for Array that can create a hash having 'key' as length of the element 
# and value as an array of all the elements of that length. Make use of forÂ­in loop for the purpose.
# Eg: ['abc','def',1234,234,'abcd','x','mnop',5,'zZzZ'] should give result as 
# {3=>["abc", "def", 234], 4=>[1234, "abcd", "mnop", "zZzZ"], 1=>["x", 5]}
